# Snakemake-Alignment_Phylogeny

## Snakemake file
### This snakemake file contains a workflow allowing the creation of MAFFT alignments and RAxML phylogenies. Inputs can either be a set of amino acid or nucleotide sequences.
### Note that the outgroup in the ProteinTree and GeneTree needs to be changed to accomodate your dataset.

## Dataset
### Contains the amino acid sequences (*P.fasta) and CDS (*G.fasta files) of the gene doublesex in mosquitoes. These were used originally in the project when I coded the workflow.
